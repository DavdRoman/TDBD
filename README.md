# TDBD

PSP button tester and UMD dumper I wrote as my very first "homebrew" project back in late 2010/early 2011. The code is beyond awful and not very easy to read for non-Spanish speakers but I wanted to keep it somewhere safe since I have very nice memories from those old times.

It's written in Lua (more specifically LuaDev a derivate PSP Lua intepreter), which was the first language I ever learnt on my own too. I remember it being so much fun.
